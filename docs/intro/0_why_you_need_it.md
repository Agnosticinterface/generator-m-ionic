# Why you need it
> Build mobile Cordova/PhoneGap apps quickly with the tools you love:
Yeoman, Gulp, Bower, AngularJS, Ionic & of course Cordova. All in one sexy generator.

## Why we built it
We built the generator because the existing tools didn't quite suit our needs. We at [M-Way Solutions](http://www.mwaysolutions.com/) wanted a tool for HTML5 mobile app development that:
- makes use of the **usual web development tooling** which is already used by web developers worldwide. Especially: Node, npm, Yeoman, Gulp, Bower.
- uses current up-to-date **industry standards for HTML5 mobile app development** without reinventing the wheel. Namely: Angular, Ionic, Cordova and it's CLI
- enables a **professional workflow** for testing, building, continuous delivery and development
of high-quality apps
- is **flexible** so it can evolve over time and can be **enhanced** on a per-project basis for special use-cases

And this generator being the result of these reflections does just that. Read more: [What's in the box](1_whats_in_the_box.md).
