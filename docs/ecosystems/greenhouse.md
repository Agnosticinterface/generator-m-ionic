# Greenhouse & Relution
> Selecting the `Greenhouse & Relution` option in the Ecosystems section during project setup will generate the `greenhouse.sh` file needed for integration with [Greenhouse](https://app.greenhouseci.com) and [Relution](https://www.relution.io/) as explained in detail in the [Greenhouse & Relution Integration Guide](../guides/greenhouse.md).

If you've missed to select this option during project setup you can create the `greenhouse.sh` file by running the greenhouse sub-generator at any time. Simply type:
```sh
yo m-ionic:greenhouse
```
Then head over to the [Greenhouse & Relution Integration Guide](../guides/greenhouse.md) to build and distribute your app in your team and among your customers!
